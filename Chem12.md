# Thermochemistry

## Concepts

* the study of energy changes in chemical processes

* 2 main types of energy involved
  
  * Kinetic energy (Energy of movement)
    
    * Vibration, tranlation, rotation within atoms and particles
    
    * Also refers to temperature
  
  * Potential energy (Energy stored in chemical bonds)
    
    * Burning things and other chemical reactions release energy
    
    * Usually released as light, heat (both if you either *super* know what you're doing or *don't* know what you're doing) or sound
  
  * Expressed in kJ 

* All chemical reactions release or absorb heat.

* System refers to the sample that is under investigation

* Everything that isn't the system, is the surroundings

* The systems and surroundings interact by exchanging energy and matter
  
  (On the left are System Types)
  
  |          | Transfers Heat | Transfers Matter |
  | -------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
  | Isolated | No             | No               |
  | Closed   | Yes            | No               |
  | Open     | Yes            | Yes              |

* Heat cannot be measured directly 
  
  * It can only be measured after a reaction is done. The change in heat is measured
  
  * For example, you can burn a piece of food and measure the released energy

* Heat and temperature are **NOT** interchangeable

* ~~Aluminum causes climate change because it melts the ice quicker~~

- Heat always travels from the warmer object to the cooler object
  
  - This happens until a thermal equilibrium is achieved
  
  ## Calculations

* The 3 methods of heat transfer are convection, conduction, and radiation
  
  - Thermal conductors tranfer heat quickly, while thermal insulators transfer heat slowly

- "calorie" (lower case) is 1/1000 of a "Calorie" (upper case)

- Temperature, $T$ is measured in $\degree$C or $\degree$K

- Specific heat capacity - c - is calculated by $\frac{q}{m\Delta T}$

* Example: If a gold ring with a mass of 5.5g warms up by 3 degrees, how much heat is absorbed?
  
  $Q=mc\Delta T \newline = 5.5\text{g} \cdot0.129\frac{\text{J}}{\text{g}}\cdot 3 \degree \text{C} \newline =  2.1 \text{J}$

* Example: What would be the final temperature of 250J of heat were transferred into 10.0g of methanol (c=2.9j/g $\degree$C) originally at 20 degrees c?
  
  $\Delta T=\frac{Q}{mc}=250J/10*2.9=8.62 \newline T_{final}=T_{initial}+\Delta T = 28.6 \degree \text{C}$

* By the first law of thermodynamics, energy is never created or destroyed, therefore, $\Delta E_{universe}=0$
  
  * Which is to say, if an object loses energy, its surroundings gain energy.
- **Enthalpy**, $H$, is the total internal energy of the system, and is expressed as $H=E+PV$ (internal energy + pressure * volume)

- Endothermic reactions occur when absorbed energy is greater than released energy, and exothermic is vice versa.

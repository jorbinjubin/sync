# Thermochemistry

## Concepts

* the study of energy changes in chemical processes

* 2 main types of energy involved
  
  * Kinetic energy (Energy of movement)
    
    * Vibration, tranlation, rotation within atoms and particles
    
    * Also refers to temperature
  
  * Potential energy (Energy stored in chemical bonds)
    
    * Burning things and other chemical reactions release energy
    
    * Usually released as light, heat (both if you either *super* know what you're doing or *don't* know what you're doing) or sound
  
  * Expressed in kJ 

* All chemical reactions release or absorb heat.

* System refers to the sample that is under investigation
  
  * Exothermic means the system loses energy and the surroundings gain energy
  
  * Endothermic means the system gains energy and the surroundings lose energy

* Everything that isn't the system, is the surroundings

* The systems and surroundings interact by exchanging energy and matter
  
  (On the left are System Types)
  
  |          | Transfers Heat | Transfers Matter |
  | -------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
  | Isolated | No             | No               |
  | Closed   | Yes            | No               |
  | Open     | Yes            | Yes              |

* Heat cannot be measured directly 
  
  * It can only be measured after a reaction is done. The change in heat is measured
  
  * For example, you can burn a piece of food and measure the released energy

* Heat and temperature are **NOT** interchangeable

* ~~Aluminum causes climate change because it melts the ice quicker~~
- Heat always travels from the warmer object to the cooler object
  
  - This happens until a thermal equilibrium is achieved
  
  ## Calculations
* The 3 methods of heat transfer are convection, conduction, and radiation
  
  - Thermal conductors tranfer heat quickly, while thermal insulators transfer heat slowly
- "calorie" (lower case) is 1/1000 of a "Calorie" (upper case)

- Temperature, $T$ is measured in $\degree$C or $\degree$K

- Specific heat capacity - c - is calculated by $\frac{Q}{m\Delta T}$
* Example: If a gold ring with a mass of 5.5g warms up by 3 degrees, how much heat is absorbed?
  
  $Q=mc\Delta T \newline = 5.5\text{g} \cdot0.129\frac{\text{J}}{\text{g}}\cdot 3 \degree \text{C} \newline =  2.1 \text{J}$

* Example: What would be the final temperature of 250J of heat were transferred into 10.0g of methanol (c=2.9j/g $\degree$C) originally at 20 degrees c?
  
  $\Delta T=\frac{Q}{mc}=250J/10*2.9=8.62 \newline T_{final}=T_{initial}+\Delta T = 28.6 \degree \text{C}$

* By the first law of thermodynamics, energy is never created or destroyed, therefore, $\Delta E_{universe}=0$
  
  * Which is to say, if an object loses energy, its surroundings gain energy.
- **Enthalpy**, $H$, is the total internal energy of the system, and is expressed as $H=E+PV$ (internal energy + pressure * volume)

- Endothermic reactions occur when absorbed energy is greater than released energy, and exothermic is vice versa.

- $\Delta H$ of melting is $-\Delta H$ of freezing, and same idea goes for vaporzation and condensation

## Thermochemistry Equations and Calorimetry

* $\Delta H$ of melting is $-\Delta H$ of freezing, and same idea goes for vaporzation and condensation

* Temperature curves involving phase changes are not linear because during the phase change, the intermolecular bonds are being broken using the energy.

* Breaking bonds requires energy and creating bonds releases energy
  
  * Edothermic vs exothermic is determined by which one of those 2 processes 
  * requires more energy

* Nuclear reactions generate many orders of magnitude above those of chemical reactions
  
  * This is due to mass defect (mass lost) which is converted into pure kinetic energy via $E=mc^2$
  
  * The $c^2$ term is nearly $10^{17}$

* Thermochemical equation steps:
  
  1. Create a balanced equation for the reaction

. Place the change in enthalpy on the correct side of the arrow (right side if negative)
  
  OR
  
  Place the change in enthalpy off to the side, $\Delta H = \pm K$ where K is the change (If positive, reaction is endothermic)

- When using $\Delta H$ notation, it needs to be per mol of substance. 
  
  $1H_{2(g)} +\frac{1}{2}O_{2(g)} \rarr 1H_2O + 241.8\text{kJ}$
  
  In that equation, the substanc to take note of is $H_2$. $\Delta H= -241.8\text{kJ}$

- Potential energy diagrams (at this point) simply show if the reaction is endothermic or exothermic. On the y-axis, you would have the potential energy.

- Always put a subscript on the $\Delta H\degree_{type} = ...$ to specify what kind of reaction took place. syn, decomp, comb, 

- The degree symbol indicates SATP.
  
  Summary of 4 methods:
  
  1. Directly insert the enthalpy in the equation
  
  2. Use $\Delta H\degree_{type}$ notation
  
  3. Molar enthalpy (Molar enthalpy for [reaction]:  $\Delta H \degree _{type} = ... \text{kJ/mol}$ [substance])

Practice question:

$N_{2(g)}+O_{2(g)} \rarr 2NO_{g}, \Delta H\degree_{comb}=+180.6\text{kJ}$

Rewrite including enthalpy as part of reaction

$N_{2(g)}+O_{2(g)}+180.6\text{kJ} \rarr 2NO_{(g)}$

Graph simply needs to show that the energy went up (exothermic). ALWAYS label the axis with kJ.

For 1 mole of nitrogen dioxide, just divide 180.6/2

$1.000\cdot10^2$g of nitrogen is reacted with sufficient oxygen. What is the change in enthalpy?

$\Delta H$ (kJ/mol) of N2O is -82.1.

$\Delta H * \frac{100g}{14.01*2+16} \newline = -186.5\text{kJ}$

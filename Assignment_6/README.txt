The Part2.java and Part3.java programs make use of File I/O.

For this reason, it is required that the following input files be placed in the 'input' folder:

SHA256 Checksum                                                    |File Name
-------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------

You may replace them with your own to prove that they have not been tampered with.

The output folder is already populated with outputs, but feel free to delete/empty the contents of them. 
They will be created by PrintWriter if they do not exist and they will be overridden if they do.

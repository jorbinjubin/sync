Basic Idea
New class - Noble, is introduced.
Item class is added - Medication, Sword, Scroll, Trinket classes extend the Item class.
Castle stays the same, but most of the other classes have changes to behaviour as follows:

DarkRoom
Now generates random loot alongside gold and radiation.

Elf
Elves have an innate sense for gold but are unable to interact with items (loot)

Noble
Nobles are there to complete an objective. This can be either to leave with a certain amount of gold and/or a certain set of items.
When they are in the same room as an Elf, they may initiate a trade.

Each item has a base exchange rate, as well as a multiplier based on its condition. 
Items can be in one of the following conditions:
Terrible
Bad 
Fair
Good
Excellent
Perfect

If a trade occurs and the Elf is able to afford the item, it will spend that amount of gold to acquire the item. 
If the item is required by the Noble as part of his objective, he will never trade it. 
If the item is not required by the Noble, he will sell it to the Elf.
